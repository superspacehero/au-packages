## Why
I'm annoyed at the lack of desktop app for voice, like hangouts had.

## What does it do
It just lets you keep voice open without a chrome browser. It will also check the dom for notifications and display a badge in the task bar and closing the app will send it to a tray instead of closing.

## Support
Currently supports both OSX, Windows 10 and Ubuntu
